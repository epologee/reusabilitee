	 * The Multi State Button
	 * 
	 * This class is an attempt to create the one-stop-button class for 
	 * pretty much all animation uses. It provides the designer with a
	 * scalable complexity of the button's timeline. The animation is 
	 * driven by labeled keyframes in the timeline.
	 *  
	 * The button may start out without any keyframes and later be enhanced
	 * with up to nine labeled keyframes. There should be NO scripts that affect the
	 * position of the playhead (stops, gotoAnd...) in the button's timeline.
	 * After that, the designer may decide what other states need to be 
	 * visualized in the animation chain:
	 * 
	 * 		[intro]      [in]        [press]
	 * 			   \    •    \      •       \
	 * 			    •  /      •    /         •
	 * 		        [up]      [over]         [down]
	 * 		       /   •     /      •       /
	 * 		      •     \   •        \     • 
	 * 		[outtro]    [out]       [release]
	 * 		
	 * 	If any of these keyframes are missing, the flow will skip over them
	 * 	to the next possible keyframe. So it would be possible to have just
	 * 	a simple setup like this:
	 * 	
	 * 		        [up] ---• [over] ---• [down]
	 *
	 *	Or one with a hard down state, but with an animated in and out sequence. 
	 * 
	 * 		             [in]        
	 * 			        •    \   
	 * 			       /      •  
	 * 		        [up]      [over] ---• [down]
	 * 		           •     /   
	 * 		            \   •     
	 * 		            [out]    
	 *	 
	 * Mouse activity is stacked, in order to maintain a fluid experience of 
	 * the button's animation flow. In lengthy animated buttons this may very
	 * soon become irritating.
